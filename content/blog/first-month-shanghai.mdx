# Your First Month in Shanghai: A Teacher's Guide

Shanghai is an incredible city that seamlessly blends ultramodern skyscrapers with traditional Chinese culture. As a new international teacher, your first month will be a whirlwind of discovery. Here's your comprehensive guide to thriving in China's largest city.

## Week 1: Getting Set Up

### Essential Apps

Your first task is getting your essential apps installed and configured:

- **WeChat (微信)**: This is non-negotiable. You'll use it for everything from messaging colleagues to paying for groceries.
- **Alipay**: Essential for payments. Most places accept both WeChat Pay and Alipay.
- **DiDi**: Shanghai's answer to Uber. Much cheaper than taxis and drivers usually arrive within 5 minutes.
- **Meituan**: For food delivery. You can get amazing meals delivered for ¥20-30 ($3-5) in under 30 minutes.

### Banking

Open a Chinese bank account as soon as you have your residence permit. Bank of China branches in Pudong and Jing'an have English-speaking staff. Bring:
- Passport
- Residence permit
- Police registration slip
- Chinese phone number
- Initial deposit (¥100 minimum)

## Week 2: Exploring Your Neighborhood

### Transportation Mastery

Shanghai's metro system is world-class. Download the Metro Daduhui app and add your bank card for contactless payments. Key tips:

- Lines 2, 10, and 11 connect most expat areas
- Avoid rush hours (8-9am, 5-7pm) if possible
- The Bund is on Line 2 (East Nanjing Road station)
- Shared bikes (Meituan/Hellobike) are perfect for short trips

### Finding Your Food Spots

Shanghai's food scene is incredible. Must-try local dishes:

**Xiaolongbao (小笼包)** - Soup dumplings that Shanghai is famous for:
- Din Tai Fung (chain, consistent quality)
- Yang's Fry Dumplings (local favorite, cheaper)

**Shengjianbao (生煎包)** - Pan-fried pork buns:
- Try the stands near any metro station in the morning

**Scallion Oil Noodles** - Simple but delicious:
- Lan Xin Restaurant in the French Concession

## Week 3: Social Life

### Meeting People

Join WeChat groups for:
- "Shanghai Expats" (general community)
- "Teachers in Shanghai" (professional network)
- Your district's expat group (Puxi, Pudong, Jing'an, etc.)

Weekend activities:
- Ultimate frisbee in Century Park (Saturdays)
- Language exchange meetups
- Explore art galleries in M50 Creative Park

### Cultural Sites to Visit

- **The Bund**: Iconic waterfront, best at sunset
- **Yu Garden**: Traditional Chinese garden in Old Town
- **Tianzifang**: Artsy neighborhood with cafes and shops
- **Shanghai Tower**: Tallest building in China, observation deck on 118th floor

## Week 4: Settling In

### Shopping for Essentials

- **Carrefour/Walmart**: Western-style supermarkets for imported goods
- **Taobao**: Online shopping for everything (furniture, appliances, clothes)
- **Ikea**: Multiple locations, delivery available

### Healthcare

Register with an international clinic for English-speaking doctors:
- Parkway Health (multiple locations)
- Shanghai United Family Hospital (expensive but excellent)

For basic needs, local pharmacies (药店) are everywhere and pharmacists can help with common ailments.

## Pro Tips for Thriving

1. **Learn Basic Chinese**: Even just "hello" (你好), "thank you" (谢谢), and "how much?" (多少钱) will help immensely
2. **Get a VPN Before Arriving**: ExpressVPN or Astrill work most reliably
3. **Join Your School's Community**: Other teachers are your best resource
4. **Embrace the Chaos**: Shanghai is fast-paced and crowded. Go with the flow!
5. **Save Your Receipts (Fapiaos)**: You'll need these for expense reimbursement

## Common First-Month Challenges

**Missing Home**: Normal! Video calls with family help. Most expats feel homesick initially.

**Language Barrier**: Use translation apps. Most younger Chinese speak some English.

**Pollution**: Check air quality apps. Invest in an air purifier for your apartment.

**Culture Shock**: Give it time. Month 2-3 get easier as you adapt to the rhythm.

## Looking Ahead

Your second month will feel dramatically easier. You'll have your routines, know your favorite restaurants, and have made friends. Shanghai has an incredible expat community, and you'll soon wonder how you lived anywhere else.

Welcome to Shanghai - you're going to love it here!
