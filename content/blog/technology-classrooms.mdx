# Technology in Chinese Classrooms

Chinese international schools are often more technologically advanced than their Western counterparts. From AI teaching assistants to sophisticated learning management systems, here's what to expect.

## The Tech Landscape

### Common Platforms You'll Use

**Learning Management Systems:**
- **ManageBac**: Popular in IB schools for curriculum planning, gradebooks, reporting
- **PowerSchool**: Used in some American curriculum schools
- **Seesaw**: Common in primary schools for student portfolios and parent communication
- **Google Classroom** or **Microsoft Teams**: Depends on school's ecosystem

**Chinese Platforms:**
- **DingTalk (钉钉)**: Like Slack + Zoom, used for staff communication, meetings, attendance
- **Xiaoheiban (小黑板)**: Parent communication platform, photos, updates, newsletters
- **WeChat Work**: Professional version of WeChat for school communication

**Assessment Tools:**
- **Toddle**: Assessment, portfolios, planning (growing popularity)
- **Standards-based grading tools**: Varies by curriculum
- **Formative assessment apps**: Kahoot, Quizizz, Nearpod, Pear Deck

### Hardware Expectations

Most classrooms are equipped with:
- Interactive whiteboards or smart boards (often 75"+ screens)
- Projectors with wireless screen sharing (AirPlay, Miracast)
- Document cameras
- Sound systems with wireless microphones
- Student devices (iPads or Chromebooks) - varies by school

## Classroom Tech Integration

### Daily Tech Use

**Morning Routine:**
- Attendance via DingTalk (often required within first 15 minutes of class)
- Display daily schedule on the smartboard
- Play calming music or brain-break videos

**During Lessons:**
- Interactive whiteboard for all instruction (say goodbye to paper charts)
- Students use devices for research, collaborative docs, creative work
- Real-time formative assessment via Kahoot/Nearpod
- Digital exit tickets

**After School:**
- Upload photos/updates to parent platform
- Update gradebook and learning goals in LMS
- Respond to parent messages on WeChat

### Parent Communication Tech

Chinese parents expect frequent tech-mediated updates:
- **Weekly photo albums**: Highlight 5-10 moments from the week
- **Video clips**: Short videos of student learning, performances, activities
- **Digital portfolios**: Student work samples, reflections, growth
- **Real-time messaging**: Quick responses to parent questions

**Tools for this:**
- WeChat moments or work groups
- Seesaw or Tadpoles (early childhood)
- School-specific parent apps

## Tech Challenges and Solutions

### The Great Firewall

**Blocked Services:**
- Google Suite (Gmail, Drive, Classroom) - unless school has enterprise VPN
- YouTube
- Many Western educational websites
- Cloud storage services

**Solutions:**
- Schools often provide VPN access for teachers
- Use Chinese alternatives: Baidu Drive instead of Google Drive, Youku instead of YouTube
- Download resources while on VPN for offline use
- Microsoft Office 365 usually works (not Google Workspace)

### Software Piracy Awareness

China has made significant progress, but be aware:
- Schools should provide licensed software
- Don't download pirated educational software
- Use free/open-source alternatives when possible
- Check licensing before using tools with students

### Tech Support

**The Good News:**
- Most schools have dedicated IT staff
- Tech issues are usually fixed quickly
- IT staff often speak some English
- Hardware is modern and well-maintained

**The Tip:**
- Make friends with your IT team early
- Learn basic troubleshooting yourself
- Have backup plans when tech fails (it will sometimes)

## Digital Citizenship and Safety

### Student Safety Online

Chinese schools take online safety seriously:
- **Filtered internet**: All student devices have content filtering
- **Monitored use**: IT tracks device usage
- **Clear policies**: Acceptable use policies for students
- **Parent involvement**: Parents receive digital citizenship resources

**Your Role:**
- Teach appropriate online behavior
- Model responsible tech use
- Report concerns to IT and administration
- Integrate digital citizenship into curriculum

### Data Privacy

- **Student photos**: Get parent permission before posting publicly
- **Personal data**: Follow school policies on data protection
- **Cloud storage**: Store student work on school-approved platforms only
- **Communication**: Use official channels, not personal accounts

## AI and Emerging Tech

### AI in Chinese Education

China leads in educational AI implementation:
- **Adaptive learning platforms**: Personalize practice and homework
- **AI tutoring**: Supplemental support for students
- **Facial recognition**: Attendance, campus security (controversial but common)
- **Speech recognition**: Language learning apps with pronunciation feedback

**Your Integration:**
- Complement, don't replace, your teaching
- Use AI tools for differentiation
- Teach students to use AI ethically
- Stay current with new educational AI tools

### Robotics and Coding

Many schools offer:
- Robotics clubs and competitions
- Coding classes (Scratch, Python)
- Maker spaces with 3D printers, electronics
- STEAM curriculum integration

Opportunity: Even if not your subject, these are great co-curricular involvement options.

## Professional Development

### Staying Current

- **School PD**: Most schools offer regular tech training
- **Online courses**: Coursera, Google for Education, Microsoft Educator Center
- **Certifications**: Google Certified Educator, Microsoft Innovative Educator, Apple Teacher
- **PLCs**: Join professional learning communities focused on edtech

### Recommended Skills

Prioritize learning:
1. Your school's LMS (ManageBac, PowerSchool, etc.)
2. Interactive whiteboard software
3. Formative assessment tools (Kahoot, Nearpod, Pear Deck)
4. Video creation/editing basics
5. Digital citizenship curriculum

## Practical Tips

**First Week:**
- Complete all required tech training
- Set up your accounts (LMS, DingTalk, parent platform)
- Test all classroom tech before students arrive
- Create digital backup lessons in case tech fails

**Throughout the Year:**
- Update parent platforms weekly (Friday afternoon works well)
- Backup important files to multiple locations
- Keep personal and professional tech separate
- Report tech issues immediately - don't struggle alone

**End of Year:**
- Archive important files before they're deleted
- Download student portfolios/work samples
- Save resources for next year
- Document what tech worked well for future reference

## The Bottom Line

Technology in Chinese classrooms enhances teaching when used thoughtfully. Embrace the tools available, stay organized, and remember: technology serves learning, not the other way around.

The skills you develop integrating technology in China will make you a more competitive educator anywhere in the world.
