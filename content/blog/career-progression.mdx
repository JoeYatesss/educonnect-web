### Do:
- **Seek mentorship**: Find a principal or director who can guide you
- **Build expertise**: Become the go-to person for something
- **Document everything**: Keep evidence of impact and achievements
- **Network strategically**: Attend conferences, join professional organizations
- **Communicate intentions**: Let current leadership know your aspirations

## The Long-Term View
