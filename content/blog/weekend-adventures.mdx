- Comfortable walking shoes
- Light jacket (weather changes)

### Language Barrier Solutions

- **Translation app**: Google Translate (download offline Chinese)
- **Hotel address card**: Get card from hotel for taxi drivers
- **Screenshot destinations**: Show taxi drivers photos of where you're going
- **Book English-speaking tours**: Via Ctrip or Klook for complex trips

### Safety

China is very safe for travelers:
- Low violent crime
- Hotels and trains are secure
- Police are helpful (though language barrier exists)
- Scams exist but are rarer than in many countries

**Common sense:**
- Watch belongings in crowded areas
- Don't flash expensive items
- Use official taxis/DiDi (not random cars)
- Share your itinerary with a friend

### Group vs. Solo Travel

**Group Travel** (organize with colleagues):
- Split costs (hotels, taxis)
- More fun for activities
- Safety in numbers
- Easier to navigate

**Solo Travel**:
- Complete flexibility
- Go at your own pace
- Easier to meet other travelers
- Challenge yourself

WeChat groups like "Weekend Warriors" organize group trips for expats.

## National Holiday Caution

**Avoid traveling during:**
- Chinese New Year (late Jan/early Feb) - week-long holiday
- National Day (Oct 1-7) - Golden Week
- May Day (May 1-5)

**Why**: Tourist sites are absolutely packed, prices double or triple, trains book out weeks ahead.

**Alternative**: Use these holidays for longer international trips (Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea) or staycations.

## Making It Happen

Don't let weekends slip by! Here's how to be a weekend adventurer:

1. **Join a travel WeChat group**: Instant trip buddies
2. **Set a goal**: Visit one new place per month
3. **Book in advance**: Wednesday night for weekend trips
4. **Be spontaneous sometimes**: Last-minute deals exist
5. **Document it**: Photos, journal, memories to treasure

## Final Thoughts

Your time teaching in China is limited. These weekend adventures will be some of your best memories - the sunrise on Huangshan, street food in Chengdu, boat rides through water towns.

China is vast, diverse, and endlessly fascinating. Get out there and explore!
